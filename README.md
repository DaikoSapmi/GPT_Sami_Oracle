# GPT_Sami_Oracle
This is the home of the SÃ¡mi Oracle a specialized GPT. It is made as a proof of concept that it is possible to combine the strength of OpenAIs GPT model with the API of the translation service of TartuNLP, the estonian translation AI for small finno ugric languages.
It is developed by Rune Fjellheim AS, [www.fjellheim.tv](https://fjellheim.tv), under the MIT-licence. Please use and improve the prompt and copy the API action as you see fit. I will update this repository as I fine tune the prompt.
