# GPT Sámi Oracle
This is the home of the [Sámi Oracle](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vWjbN6qdJ-sami-oracle) - a specialized GPT. It is made as a proof of concept that it is possible to combine the strength of OpenAIs GPT model with the API of the translation service of TartuNLP, the estonian translation AI for small finno ugric languages.
It is developed by Rune Fjellheim AS, [fjellheim.tv](https://fjellheim.tv), under the MIT-licence. Please use and improve the prompt and copy the API action as you see fit. I will update this repository as I fine tune the prompt.

1. The **configure.txt** has the content you should use under the configure tab when creating a new GPT. Copy the text under the the respective headlines; Name, Description and Instructions.
2. Add an action and copy the tartunlp_api_schema.json to the TartuNLP and paste it under **Schema**.
3. At the bottom of the action page, paste the following website in the **privacy policy** field
4. Upload the Languages.md to your **Knowledge** section to make sure that the GPT knows how to find language pairs.

Enjoy!
